# Auxiliary Optimization Rules

Kyuubi provides SQL extension out of box. Due to the version compatibility with Apache Spark, currently we support Apache Spark branch-3.1 and later.
And don't worry, Kyuubi will support the new Apache Spark version in the future. Thanks to the adaptive query execution framework (AQE), Kyuubi can do these optimizations.

## Features

- merging small files automatically
  
  Small files is a long time issue with Apache Spark. Kyuubi can merge small files by adding an extra shuffle.
  Currently, Kyuubi supports handle small files with datasource table and hive table, and also Kyuubi support optimize dynamic partition insertion.
  For example, a common write query `INSERT INTO TABLE $table1 SELECT * FROM $table2`, Kyuubi will introduce an extra shuffle before write and then the small files will go away.


- insert shuffle node before Join to make AQE OptimizeSkewedJoin work

  In current implementation, Apache Spark can only optimize skewed join by the standard join which means a join must have two sort and shuffle node.
  However, in complex scenario this assuming will be broken easily. Kyuubi can guarantee the join is standard by adding an extra shuffle node before join.
  So that, OptimizeSkewedJoin can work better.


- stage level config isolation in AQE

  As we know, `spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes` is a key config in Apache Spark AQE.
  It controls how big data size per-task should handle during shuffle, so we always use a 64MB or a smaller value to make parallelism enough.
  However, in general, we expect a file is big enough like 256MB or 512MB. Kyuubi can make the config isolation to solve the conflict so that
  we can make staging partition data size small and last partition data size big.


## Usage

| Kyuubi Spark SQL extension | Supported Spark version(s) | Available since  | EOL | Bundled in Binary release tarball | Maven profile |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|-----|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| kyuubi-extension-spark-3-1 | 3.1.x                      | 1.3.0-incubating | N/A | 1.3.0-incubating                  | spark-3.1     |
| kyuubi-extension-spark-3-2 | 3.2.x                      | 1.4.0-incubating | N/A | 1.4.0-incubating                  | spark-3.2     |
| kyuubi-extension-spark-3-3 | 3.3.x                      | 1.6.0-incubating | N/A | 1.6.0-incubating                  | spark-3.3     |

1. Check the matrix that if you are using the supported Spark version, and find the corresponding Kyuubi Spark SQL Extension jar
2. Get the Kyuubi Spark SQL Extension jar
   1. Each Kyuubi binary release tarball only contains one default version of Kyuubi Spark SQL Extension jar, if you are looking for such version, you can find it under `$KYUUBI_HOME/extension`
   2. All supported versions of Kyuubi Spark SQL Extension jar will be deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=kyuubi-extension-spark)
   3. If you like, you can compile Kyuubi Spark SQL Extension jar by yourself, please activate the corresponding Maven's profile on you compile command, i.e. you can get Kyuubi Spark SQL Extension jar for Spark 3.1 under `extensions/spark/kyuubi-extension-spark-3-1/target` when compile with `-Pspark-3.1`
3. Put the Kyuubi Spark SQL extension jar `kyuubi-extension-spark-*.jar` into `$SPARK_HOME/jars`
4. Enable `KyuubiSparkSQLExtension`, i.e. add a config into `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf`, `spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.kyuubi.sql.KyuubiSparkSQLExtension`

Now, you can enjoy the Kyuubi SQL Extension.
