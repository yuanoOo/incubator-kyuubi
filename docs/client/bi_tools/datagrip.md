# DataGrip
## What is DataGrip
[DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) is a multi-engine database environment released by JetBrains, supporting MySQL and PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle, Sybase, DB2, SQLite, HyperSQL, Apache Derby, and H2.

## Preparation
### Get DataGrip And Install
Please go to [Download DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/download) to get and install an appropriate version for yourself.
### Get Kyuubi Started
[Get kyuubi server started](../../quick_start/quick_start.html) before you try DataGrip with kyuubi.

For debugging purpose, you can use `tail -f` or `tailf` to track the server log.
## Configurations
### Start DataGrip
After you install DataGrip, just launch it.
### Select Database
Substantially, this step is to choose a JDBC Driver type to use later. We can choose Apache Hive to set up a driver for Kyuubi.

### Datasource Driver
You should first download the missing driver files. Just click on the link below, DataGrip will download and install those.

### Generic JDBC Connection Settings
After install drivers, you should configure the right host and port which you can find in kyuubi server log. By default, we use `localhost` and `10009` to configure.

Of course, you can fill other configs.

After generic configs, you can use test connection to test.
