# Apache Kyuubi(Incubating) Maturity Self Assessment

## Overview

This is an assessment of the overall maturity of Apache Kyuubi(Incubating) as an Apache project, meant to inform the decision (of mentors, community, incubator PMCs, and ASF Board of Directors) to graduate Kyuubi as a top-level Apache project. It is based on the [Apache Project Maturity Model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html).

Mentors and community members are encouraged to contribute to this page and comment on it, the following tables summarize our self-assessment against the **Apache Project Maturity Model**.

:white_check_mark: means that the related item is in good status.
:white_large_square: means that the related item need long-term attention.
:x: means that the related item need to be fixed ASAP.

| CS10 | The project maintains a public list of its contributors who have decision power. The project's PMC (Project Management Committee) consists of those contributors.                                                         | :white_check_mark: Committers and PPMC members are listed on the website’s community page, see [newcommitter](https://kyuubi.apache.org/become_committer.html), [newppmc](https://kyuubi.apache.org/become_pmc_member.html) |
| CS20 | Decisions require a consensus among PMC members and are documented on the project's main communications channel. The PMC takes community opinions into account, but the PMC has the final word.                           | :white_check_mark: The project has been making important decisions on the mailing lists.                                                                                                                                    |
| CS30 | The project uses documented voting rules to build consensus when discussion is not sufficient.                                                                                                                            | :white_check_mark: The project uses the standard ASF voting rules.                                                                                                                                                          |
| CS40 | In Apache projects, vetoes are only valid for code commits. The person exercising the veto must justify it with a technical explanation, as per the Apache voting rules defined in CS30.                                  | :white_check_mark: We've used vetoes with clear technical explanations for code commits only.                                                                                                                               |
| CS50 | All "important" discussions happen asynchronously in written form on the project's main communications channel. Offline, face-to-face or private discussions that affect the project are also documented on that channel. | :white_check_mark: The project has been making important decisions on the project mailing lists. Minor decisions may occasionally happen during code reviews, which are also asynchronous and in written form.              |
